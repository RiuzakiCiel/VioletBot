# VioletBot
Discord bot for a little weeb server.

**Instructions to use this yourself**
<br /> Go to [the github developer site](https://discordapp.com/developers/) and create an application
<br /> Create a bot in that application by pressing the *bot* button and copy the bot token and the client ID
<br /> Go to [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=8) and replace `CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE` with your client ID. Then select your server.
<br /> Your bot should now be invited in your server, although it's offline.
<br /> to fix that, open `main.py` and enter the bot token
<br /> You should now have the bot running!
