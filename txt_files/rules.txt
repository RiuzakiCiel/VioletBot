Do not impersonate people. You can swear in this server but do not use any racial/sexist/etc. (you know the drill) words.
Keep the channels on topic. this applies to voice channels too!
Read the description of the chat you're in to make sure you are not breaking any rules there, we are not super strict and let a lot just slip by, but you don't want to have the chance to be kicked. This applies to voice channels too!
We do not tolerate useless @'s or @'s to random people. Do not tag mods unless it's really necessary!
Do not tease people with their spelling of words, only if they really ask for help.
Do not spam. Spamming is one of the easiest ways to get a warning/ban.
Don't do drama. it's as simple as that.
This is an english speaking server, so keep communicating to that language.
